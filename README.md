- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heanorth93
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things related to cybersecurity, coding, and web development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Powershell, Python, and later on Ruby

I'm looking to improve my skills with coding to make myself a better cybersecurity analyst and maybe even pick up some fun projects on the side.
